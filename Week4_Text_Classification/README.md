# Week 4: Data Science Bootcamp - The Text Classification Project
   
### Background problem / Goal:
In this project, we will build a text classification model on song lyrics by web scraping lyrics from any artist on lyrics.com and train a lyrics predictor model to predict the artist of the song/text.

### Tools/Libraries Used: 
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Wordcloud, nltk, BeautifulSoup

### Workflow:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Inspection and exploration
3. Cleaning and preparation
4. Visualization
5. Modeling & Evaluation
6. Forecasting
7. Summary & Further Outlook

### Files in this Repository:
1. [Code Folder](https://github.com/pbamoo/Artist_Lyrics_Classifier/tree/main/Code): [**1_scrape_Kirk.ipynb**](https://github.com/pbamoo/Artist_Lyrics_Classifier/blob/main/Code/1_scrape_Kirk.ipynb) & [**2_scrape_Enya.ipynb**](https://github.com/pbamoo/Artist_Lyrics_Classifier/blob/main/Code/2_scrape_Enya.ipynb) are the notebooks containing the process & the scraped lyrics for our 2 chosen artist Kirk Franklin & Enya respectively, while [**4_other_scraper.ipynb**](https://github.com/pbamoo/Artist_Lyrics_Classifier/blob/main/Code/4_other_scraper.ipynb) shows other forms of scraping the lyrics & [**5_model.ipynb**](https://github.com/pbamoo/Artist_Lyrics_Classifier/blob/main/Code/5_model.ipynb) is the jupyter notebook containing all models.

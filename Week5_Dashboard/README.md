# Week 5: The Dashboard Project
   
### Background problem / Goal:
The goal for this project was to build a metabase dashboard summarizing the Northwind Database which contains all sales transactions between the fictional company “Northwind Traders” and its customers as well as purchases from Northwinds suppliers. The dashboard will be built on top of a Postgres database that runs in the AWS cloud.
The data is available [here](https://github.com/pawlodkowski/northwind_data_clean).

### Workflow:
1. Install PostgreSQL based on your OS and create a Postgres database called e.g Northwind
2. Download the data from [here](https://github.com/pawlodkowski/northwind_data_clean)
3. Create the table definitions, i.e. one table per CSV file
4. Create foreign keys to connect the tables
5. Load the CSV files into the database
6. Explore and answer possible questions on the data in SQL
7. Upload the data to a cloud database
8. Build an interactive dashboard on a cloud server

# Bike_Demand_Prediction
Regression model to predict demand for bicycle rentals

### Background problem / Goal:
The challenge of this week was to build and train a regression model on the Capital Bike Share in Washington D.C [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/data), in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather.

### Tools/Libraries Used: 
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

### Workflow:
1. Data Acquisition
2. Inspection and exploration
3. Cleaning and preparation
4. Visualization
5. Modeling & Evaluation
6. Forecasting
7. Summary & Further Outlook
